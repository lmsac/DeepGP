# Model
The model is available at the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J4CKnsrikETNgcLj9xL5eRjWqC0oQx8Q). Upon official publication, the model will also be made publicly accessible on the GitHub 'Releases' page.

Here are the trained DeepGP models. These models are organized into five subfolders, each denoted by the following names: DeepFLR, human, mouse, human&mouse and mouse_rt.

DeepFLR: This is the base model.

mouse: This is the DeepGP model for spectra prediction trained with mouse datasets, built on top of the DeepFLR base model.

human: This is the DeepGP model for spectra prediction trained with human datasets, built on top of the DeepFLR base model.

human&mouse: This is the DeepGP model for spectra prediction trained with both human and mouse datasets, built on top of the DeepFLR base model.

mouse_rt: The is the DeepGP model for retention time prediction trained with mouse datasets, built on top of the DeepFLR base model.

# Demo data 2
The demo data for iRT prediction is available at the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ysrME3schgZHtxB4JL114MrvyNnXx6_k). The demo data will also be made publicly accessible on the GitHub 'Releases' page.

This demo data is for clear and comprehensive presentation of iRT pre-processing, calibration, model training, and prediction. It includes three relatively large mouse datasets.
